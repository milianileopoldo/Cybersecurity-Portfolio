# Miliani_Leopoldo_Portfolio
 This is a curated collection of academic projects, cybersecurity work, and creative tech explorations. This repository showcases my growth as a cybersecurity student, including hands-on projects in threat intelligence, defensive security, designs, and more. Built to reflect both technical ability and design thinking.
